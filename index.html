    <h2>Chapter Summaries & Analyses</h2>
    
    <!-- Chapter 1 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 onclick="toggleContent('chapter1-content')">Chapter 1: The Sound of the Shell</h3>
      <div id="chapter1-content" class="content">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The novel opens with a plane crash that leaves a group of British schoolboys stranded on a deserted island. Among them are Ralph and Piggy, who discover a conch shell and decide to use it as a horn to call the others. This summons the boys, including Jack, who is the leader of the choirboys, and Simon, a quieter, more reflective character. Ralph is elected as the leader over Jack, who becomes visibly resentful but is given control over the choir, turning them into hunters. Together, the boys begin to explore the island, and Jack, in a failed attempt to kill a pig, vows to catch one next time.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong>The conch shell represents order, authority, and communication. Its discovery and use to summon the boys is symbolic of their initial commitment to societal norms and democratic structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Characterization:</strong>Ralph is presented as charismatic and diplomatic, while Piggy, with his glasses and awkwardness, symbolizes intelligence and vulnerability. Jack is introduced as aggressive and power-seeking.</li>
          <li><strong>Imagery:</strong>The island is initially described with lush, idyllic imagery, creating a false sense of paradise that contrasts with the darkness that unfolds.</li>
          <li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong>Jack’s resentment of Ralph’s leadership hints at future power struggles, emphasizing the theme of rivalry.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 2 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 onclick="toggleContent('chapter2-content')">Chapter 2: Fire on the Mountain</h3>
      <div id="chapter2-content" class="content">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ralph gathers the boys to establish rules, including the importance of keeping a signal fire burning for rescue. The boys start a fire using Piggy’s glasses, but it quickly grows out of control, highlighting their lack of responsibility. When they take a headcount, they realize a littlun is missing, likely killed by the out-of-control fire.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The signal fire represents hope for rescue but also the dangers of unchecked power; when it rages out of control, it mirrors the boys' descent into chaos.</li>
        <li><strong>Irony:</strong>The fire, which was intended as a means of rescue, becomes a source of destruction, demonstrating the boys' naivety and lack of foresight. </li>
        <li><strong>Allegory:</strong>The island serves as a microcosm of society, with the boys' failed attempts to establish order reflecting the fragility of human civilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Diction:</strong> Golding’s choice of words, such as “flame,” “rage,” and “devour,” implies a dangerous energy that foreshadows the destructive behavior to come.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 onclick="toggleContent('chapter3-content')">Chapter 3: Huts on the Beach</h3>
      <div id="chapter3-content" class="content">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ralph and Simon work to build shelters while the others neglect their duties, preferring to play or hunt with Jack. Ralph grows frustrated with Jack, who is obsessed with killing a pig and starts painting his face to camouflage. Tensions between Jack and Ralph’s priorities (fun and hunting vs. shelter and rescue) begin to rise, and Simon retreats into the jungle to find peace, showing his sensitivity and spirituality.</p>
          <ul>
        <li><strong>Juxtaposition:</strong>The contrasts between Ralph and Jack’s priorities highlight the conflict between civilization (shelters) and savagery (hunting).</li>
        <li><strong>Motif of Masks:</strong>Jack’s face paint is a literal and figurative mask, symbolizing his release from societal expectations and the emergence of his primal instincts.</li>
        <li><strong>Allusion:</strong>Simon’s retreat into nature and his empathy for it alludes to Christ-like qualities, suggesting he represents moral purity and introspection.</li>
        <li><strong>Tone:</strong>Golding creates tension and foreboding through Ralph’s frustrations and Jack’s obsession with hunting, setting up an ominous atmosphere.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 onclick="toggleContent('chapter4-content')">Chapter 4: Painted Faces and Long Hair</h3>
      <div id="chapter4-content" class="content">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The boys become further divided as Jack and his hunters become more fixated on hunting and rituals. While they successfully kill a pig, they let the signal fire go out, missing a passing ship. Ralph is furious, but Jack is dismissive, believing hunting is more important. This failure creates a growing rift between Ralph and Jack, and Piggy’s glasses are damaged in a fight with Jack, symbolizing a crack in rational thought and order.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong>Piggy’s glasses symbolize rationality and foresight, their damage signifying the breakdown of rational order on the island.</li>
        <li><strong>Dramatic Irony:</strong> The reader is aware of the danger of losing the signal fire, yet the boys are oblivious, creating a tension between innocence and impending doom.</li>
        <li><strong>Pathos:</strong>Golding’s depiction of Piggy’s vulnerability evokes sympathy, emphasizing the fragility of intellect and reason against the force of unchecked aggression.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 5 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 onclick="toggleContent('chapter5-content')">Chapter 5: Beast from Water</h3>
      <div id="chapter5-content" class="content">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ralph tries to assert control and restore order by reminding the boys of the importance of rules, like keeping the fire going and using a designated toilet area. However, fear of a "beast" begins to dominate the boys' thoughts, particularly after a littlun claims to have seen it emerge from the ocean. Jack dismisses the beast and promises to hunt it, but uses the boys’ fear to gain their support. As the group becomes chaotic, only Ralph, Piggy, and Simon remain behind, discussing the importance of staying organized.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong>The beast represents the boys’ internal fears and primal instincts; it’s a manifestation of their loss of innocence and descent into savagery.</li>
        <li><strong>Allusion and Archetype:</strong>The “beast” evokes the archetypal devil figure and is an allusion to humanity’s inherent evil. In a Freudian sense, the beast is a manifestation of the id.</li>
        <li><strong>Metaphor:</Strong>Golding uses phrases like “the darkness within” to illustrate the theme of inherent human savagery, suggesting that the true beast resides within each boy. </li>
        <li><strong>Paradox:</strong>The boys fear the beast yet are drawn to it, reflecting the paradox of human nature’s simultaneous attraction to and fear of darkness and power.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 6 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 onclick="toggleContent('chapter6-content')">Chapter 6: Beast from Air</h3>
      <div id="chapter6-content" class="content">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> During the night, a dead parachutist lands on the island, mistaken by Sam and Eric for the beast. The boys embark on a hunt for the beast, exploring a part of the island they haven’t seen before. Ralph and Jack briefly rekindle their bond, but the other boys are distracted by fantasies of building a fort. Ralph’s frustration grows as the boys lose sight of their goal to find the beast and maintain the signal fire.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The parachutist is a grim reminder of the war beyond the island. As fear grows, Jack uses it to undermine Ralph’s authority, steering the boys towards savagery.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong>The parachutist symbolizes the violence of the outside world and the idea that the “beast” is not just within the boys but is a larger human condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong>The boys’ excitement over building a fort hints at the violent conflicts to come, as their impulse to create a stronghold mirrors their descent into tribalism.</li>
        <li><strong>Irony:</Strong> The “beast” they fear is simply a dead body, suggesting that the real horrors are not monstrous creatures but rather human-made conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Personification: </strong>Golding describes the parachutist as “moving” with the wind, creating a terrifying yet poignant image of how violence persists, even in death, further haunting the boys and symbolizing the inescapable nature of war.</li>
        </ul>
